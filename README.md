This repository aims to be an archive of my adventure to learn the Rust progamming lanuage and become a Rustacean.The code here follows the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) in the Rust documentation. The code may be the same as in the book for some sections, or I may have changed it. I will also usually add notes to each for myself in each section.

Please note that the notes I take are for personal use and probably shouldn't be used to learn Rust for yourself. The notes are also in an abbreviated format and may be missing information you would find helpful.
