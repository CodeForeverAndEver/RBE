This repository aims to be an archive of my adventure to learn the Rust progamming lanuage and become a Rustacean.The code here follows the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/title-page.html) in the Rust documentation. The code may be the same as in the book for some sections, or I may have changed it. I will also usually add notes to each for myself in each section.
