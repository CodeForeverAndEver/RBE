# Installation Notes
`rustup` is used to install Rust, manage versions and associated tools. It can be installed with `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh` on Linux (my OS).

Commands:
* `rustup update` - update Rust
* `rustup self uninstall` - uninstall Rust
* `rustc --version` - get version, good check if Rust is installed.
* `rustup doc` - open local documentation

**Reminder**: These notes are in an abbreviated format that I find useful. However, they probably shouldn't be used to learn Rust. At best they may be a helpful chapter section summary.
